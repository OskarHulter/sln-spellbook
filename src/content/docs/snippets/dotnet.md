## Redirected Input

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/upgrade>

The universal method for passing request data is through redirected stdin (standard input)â€”piping.

By default, stdin data is buffered and then with no further processing used as the request body. If you provide Content-Length, then the request body is streamed without buffering. You may also use --chunked to enable streaming via chunked transfer encoding or --compress, -x to compress the request body.

There are multiple useful ways to use piping:

Redirect from a file:

## Pattern matching

```c#
public static string Play(int number) 
{
  return number switch
  {
    _ when number.IsDivisibleBy(15)
      => "FizzBuzz",
    _ when number.IsDivisibleBy(3)
      => "Fizz",
    _ when number.IsDivisibleBy(5)
      => "Buzz",
    _ => number.ToString()
  };
}
```

```c#
[Theory]
[InlineData(15)]
[InlineData(30)]
[InlineData(60)]
public void GivenNumberDivisibleBy3And5_ThenReturnsFizzBuzz
{
  var result = FizzBuzzGame.Play(number);
  
  reult.Should().Be("FizzBuzz");
}
```
