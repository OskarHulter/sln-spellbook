## Intro to mental models

As you learn more about coding you will notice that a few

### Names - labels

"to name a thing is to control it"

### Trees - relationship between boxes

Just flip the real tree upside down, and we get the common data structure.

### Root - box at the point of origin. The start of the structure

### Branch - the connection between the root and boxes

### Leaf - the final box at the end of a branch
