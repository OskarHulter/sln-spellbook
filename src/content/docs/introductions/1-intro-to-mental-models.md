The only failure is not trying.
Try to follow your own curiousity
Unintended results are a chance to learn,
Therefore they will actually be more valuable than success.

Imagine that each instruction you try to follow had unintended results.
A lot of people might feel disappointed or get a feeling that I don't belong. That is your ego speaking and it's trying to protect you from a negative feeling. But that will hinder your growth as you seek to minimize the discomfort of identifying with your result.

If this sounds familiar, remind yourself that you are not your results - while we can affect the outcome, the final result is based on probability.

Then you must remind yourself:
I'm not failing, the feedback accelerates the process that I care about: learning.

"to name a thing is to control it"

Concepts

Trees - relationship between boxes
Root - box at the point of origin
Branch - the connection between root and other boxes.
Leaf - the final box at the end of a branch

Just flip the tree upside down, because the hierarchy of a real tree is inverted to capture the value in the right order.
